<p>"Actually, I am looking to transition out of academia."</p>
<p>It took her a moment to process what I had just said. We had met at conferences, too many to recall, and now she was visiting the Psychology department at New York University, where I work as a postdoc. A moment passed. "So, you want to stay in New York?", she asked. "Yes." I saw her nodding and I knew what she was thinking. I continued "I chose passion." She started to smile. "Passion for my job." In her face, I saw the, quite intended, confusion.</p>
<p>I had chosen my words very carefully. Practice makes the master, as they say, and I had become quite skilled at reading people's assumptions about why I had decided to pursue the non-academic path. After months of confessions to colleagues, I had started taking pleasure in playing with their assumptions. I now dare to imply that maybe jobs outside science are pretty awesome, too.</p>
<p>If people leave academia, it's because they prefer living in a big, exciting city above a small, boring city. If people leave academia, it's because they prefer living close to rather than far away from their partner. If people could live in a big, exciting city <b>and</b> close to their partner <b>and</b> do science, they would. Right?</p>
<p>"Some academics assume that if you are undertaking doctoral research, you must be aiming for an academic career; anything else would be second best (or even 'failure')." according to the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2013/jun/18/postdoc-dilemma-leave-stay-academia">Guardian in June 2013</a>.</p>
<p>Assumptions like these make it hard for academics to talk about anything but their academic career aspirations; who would like to admit to failure? Choosing second best? Not being good enough to land a job in the city they want to live in and with the person they want to be with? As a consequence, academics lack a support network when it comes to thinking about leaving or preparing for the non-academic job market.</p>
<p>We started this group, the DataPirates, to provide a much needed network: a platform for academics to talk about and prepare for non-academic jobs and, in particular, data science jobs.</p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 17.0px Times"><b>We do</b></h3>
<p>We use open data and tools to answer interesting questions while, in the process, strengthening our programming and data analytic abilities. Learning new skills by completing tutorials and exercises is one thing (e.g. check out <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">codeacademy</a>). Being able to apply those skills to real world problems is another. To learn, we dive into data with the aim to discover real answers to real problems. What could be more interesting?</p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 17.0px Times"><b>We share</b></h3>
<p>We aim to share useful resources we discovered in preparing ourselves for a career in data science. It is a widespread assumption within academia that once you are ready to "sell out", it will be easy to land a job. And while it might be easy to get any job, getting the job that will make you happy, provide the right growth opportunities, and in a company that fits your personality requires some <a href="http://insightdatascience.com/blog/preparing_for_insight.html">preparation</a>. We will share what we used and found useful in preparing ourselves for a career in data science.</p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 17.0px Times"><b>We collaborate</b></h3>
<p>We aim to focus on questions and answers - the project. Perhaps driven by the limited number of opportunities within academia, perhaps by their almost infinite years of schooling, academics have gotten used to competing with each other. I certainly have witnessed a great many "Who is the smartest kid in the room?" conversations. Who cares? We aim to focus on questions, not people, and use our skills and talents to find the best answers.</p>
<p>Every Datapirate has his or her own motivations for getting involved. While I am excited about the world of data science, academia may never have been a good fit for me, I acknowledge that life for non-tenured academic has gotten <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/03/inquiring-minds-ethan-perlstein-postdocalypse">increasingly harder</a>. I have met a great many academics, who are very angry and very bitter. Funding schemes are suboptimal, I agree, and <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/2013/01/27/short-grant-rant-on-broken-promises/">good people are sometimes forced out of their desired career path</a>. "It is an amazing time to do science, but an incredibly difficult time to be a scientist.", to quote <a href="http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1270">Michael Eisen</a>, and he is right.</p>
<p>But I also like Ethan Pearlstein's approach. On Twitter, he said "we need to experiment with the way we experiment.", "life won't end outside academia, people!" and "we need to start thinking that science can happen outside of fucking academia" (in an exchange on <a href="https://storify.com/scicurious/academic-science-what-needs-to-change">how to change NIH funding</a>). While I say that I have chosen a non-academic career path, I believe academic vs. non-academic to be a false dichotomy. Science can happen anywhere. It just requires curious people with creative minds.</p>
